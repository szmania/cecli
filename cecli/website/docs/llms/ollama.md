# Ollama

Cecli can connect to local Ollama models.

First, install cecli:

```bash
uv tool install cecli-dev
```

Then configure your Ollama API endpoint (usually the default):

```bash
export OLLAMA_API_BASE=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 # Mac/Linux
setx   OLLAMA_API_BASE http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1 # Windows, restart shell after setx
```

Start working with cecli and Ollama on your codebase:

```
# Pull the model
ollama pull <model>

# Start your ollama server, increasing the context window to 8k tokens
OLLAMA_CONTEXT_LENGTH=8192 ollama serve

# In another terminal window, change directory into your codebase
cd /to/your/project

cecli --model ollama/<model>
```


See the [model warnings](warnings.html) section for information on warnings which will occur when working with models that cecli is not familiar with.

## API Key

If you are using an ollama that requires an API key you can set `OLLAMA_API_KEY`:

```
export OLLAMA_API_KEY=<api-key> # Mac/Linux
setx   OLLAMA_API_KEY <api-key> # Windows, restart shell after setx
```

## Setting the context window size

[Ollama uses a 2k context window by default](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/faq.md#how-can-i-specify-the-context-window-size), which is very small for working with cecli. It also **silently** discards context that exceeds the window. This is especially dangerous because many users don't even realize that most of their data is being discarded by Ollama.
 
By default, cecli sets Ollama's context window to be large enough for each request you send plus 8k tokens for the reply. This ensures data isn't silently discarded by Ollama.

If you'd like a fixed sized context window, set `num_ctx` in the `api` block of your [model configuration](../config/model-configuration.html). cecli passes it to Ollama as a native runner option:

```yaml
model-overrides:
  defaults:
    ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16:
      api:
        num_ctx: 65536
```

The same settings can be scoped to a suffix (for example `ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16:extended`) so you can switch context sizes per invocation:

```yaml
model-overrides:
  ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16:
    extended:
      api:
        num_ctx: 131072
```

Then run cecli with `--model ollama/qwen2.5-coder:32b-instruct-fp16:extended` if you want the larger window.
