## Prompt Queue Management

| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **/queue** | Queue a prompt for processing after current tasks complete |
| **/list-queue** | List all prompts currently in the queue |
| **/remove-queue** | Remove a prompt from the queue by index, or '*' to clear all |

{: .tip }

## Prompt Queue Management Commands

The prompt queue management feature (`CLI-33`) adds three new commands for managing a first-in-first-out (FIFO) queue of prompts.

### Queue Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **/queue** | Queue a prompt for processing after current tasks complete |
| **/insert-queue** | Insert a prompt at a specific position in the queue |
| **/list-queue** | List all prompts currently in the queue |
| **/remove-queue** | Remove a prompt from the queue by index, or '*' to clear all |

#### `/queue` Command

**Usage:** `/queue <prompt text>`

**Description:** Adds a prompt to the queue for processing after the current command completes.

**Arguments:**
- `prompt text`: Required. The prompt text to queue (maximum 10,000 characters)

**Returns:** Confirmation message with the queue position number

**Examples:**
```bash
/queue "refactor database layer"
/queue "add unit tests for user service"
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `NORM_NAME = "queue"`
- `DESCRIPTION = "Queue a prompt for processing after current tasks complete"`
- `execute()`: Validates input, calls `coder.commands._enqueue_prompt()`, returns position confirmation
- `get_help()`: Returns usage and examples

#### `/list-queue` Command

**Usage:** `/list-queue`

**Description:** Displays all prompts currently in the queue with their position numbers and timestamps.

**Arguments:** None

**Returns:** Numbered list of queued prompts (`[index] text (timestamp)`) or "Queue is empty" message

**Examples:**
```bash
/list-queue
# Output: [1] refactor database layer (2026-08-01 10:30:00)
#         [2] add unit tests for user service (2026-08-01 10:30:05)
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `NORM_NAME = "list-queue"`
- `DESCRIPTION = "List all prompts currently in the queue"`
- `execute()`: Accesses queue, formats output with timestamps and truncated text, handles empty queue
- `get_help()`: Returns usage and examples

#### `/insert-queue` Command

**Usage:** `/insert-queue <prompt text>`, `/insert-queue <index> <prompt text>`

**Description:** Inserts a prompt at a specific position in the queue. When called without an index, the prompt is added at the front of the queue.

**Arguments:**
- `index`: Optional. Position at which to insert the prompt
- `prompt text`: Required. The prompt text to insert

**Returns:** Confirmation message with the queue position number

**Examples:**
```bash
/insert-queue "add tests for login"
/insert-queue 3 "refactor database layer"
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `NORM_NAME = "insert-queue"`
- `DESCRIPTION = "Insert a prompt at a specific position in the queue"`
- `execute()`: Validates input, calls `coder.commands._insert_prompt()`, returns position confirmation
- `get_help()`: Returns usage and examples

#### `/remove-queue` Command

**Usage:** `/remove-queue <index>`, `/remove-queue *`, or `/remove-queue` (interactive)

**Description:** Removes a specific prompt from the queue by index, clears the entire queue with `*`, or provides interactive selection when called with no arguments.

**Arguments:**
- `index`: Optional. 0-based index of the prompt to remove, or `*` wildcard to clear all

**Returns:** Confirmation of removal and updated queue state

**Examples:**
```bash
/remove-queue 2          # Remove prompt at index 2
/remove-queue *          # Clear entire queue
/remove-queue            # Interactive selection mode
```

**Implementation Details:**
- `NORM_NAME = "remove-queue"`
- `DESCRIPTION = "Remove a prompt from the queue by index, or '*' to clear all"`
- `execute()`: Handles `*` wildcard, numbered index, and interactive mode
- `get_help()`: Returns usage and examples
- `get_completions()`: Returns index numbers + `*` for tab completion

#### Error Handling

All queue commands follow consistent error handling patterns:
- `ValueError`: Raised for empty prompts or None values in `/queue`
- `IndexError`: Raised for out-of-bounds indices in `/remove-queue`
- Usage errors: Non-integer indices, invalid arguments show user-friendly messages
- Null checks: Handle `coder.commands` is None gracefully with error messages

#### Thread Safety

The queue uses an `asyncio.Lock` (`_queue_lock`) to protect all read and write operations, ensuring atomic updates in the single-threaded async event loop.

## Non-TUI Related Notes

### Multi-line Chat Messages

You can send long, multi-line messages in the chat in a few ways:
  - Paste a multi-line message directly into the chat.
  - Enter `{` alone on the first line to start a multiline message and `}` alone on the last line to end it.
    - Or, start with `{tag` (where "tag" is any sequence of letters/numbers) and end with `tag}`. This is useful when you need to include closing braces `}` in your message.
  - Use Meta-ENTER to start a new line without sending the message (Esc+ENTER in some environments).
  - Use `/paste` to paste text from the clipboard into the chat.
  - Use the `/editor` command (or press `Ctrl-X Ctrl-E` if your terminal allows) to open your editor to create the next chat message. See [editor configuration docs](../config/editor.html) for more info.
  - Use multiline-mode, which swaps the function of Meta-Enter and Enter, so that Enter inserts a newline, and Meta-Enter submits your command. To enable multiline mode:
    - Use the `/multiline-mode` command to toggle it during a session.
    - Use the `--multiline` switch.
  
Example with a tag:
```
{python
def hello():
    print("Hello}")  # Note: contains a brace
python}
```
